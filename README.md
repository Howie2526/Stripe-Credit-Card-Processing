# Stripe-Credit-Card-Processing

I am the founder of a legally registered not for profit organization, meaning we have little to no income. I am attempting to integrate Stripe Credit Card donations into our website, and I have limited programming skill which is why i have come to GitHub. I am hoping to find more experienced programmers to offer their assistance in making this credit card donation page as secure as possible, I am looking to use secure authentication and not tokens even though tokens are mentioned in the files.

I have three different files, index.php basically checks to see which address they came from, if they came from say https://cdunion.ca/index.php they will be redirected to https://cdunion.ca/ so I have some constants and dont have three or 4 different urls in search engines all leading to the same page. Body.php is the main html code for the page, and stripe.php is the php programming which connects to the Stripe server.

My main concern is the Stripe form and processing the credit card transaction as securely as possible with this project but if you have any ideals on how to improve other parts of the page, feel free to let me know please, I'm not an experienced programmer so some of the things I have done probably is not the best or most efficient way to do them, thank you.

PS The credit card number, cvc and expiry date listed in my php form is a dummy test card number used by all credit card processors for testing, so no private information has been released. :)
