# Stripe-Credit-Card-Processing

We are a Canadian registered not for profit organization which means we have little to no income.

We are requesting assistance with integration of Stripe into our website. We currently have a working and secure integration of Stripe which fully complies with North American regulations and standards. We are looking to improve our code whether it be speed improvements, best practices or something else. We have listed what we are seeking assistance with below.

1. Any improvement, whether it be speed, efficiency or best practices.
2. is there a better way to transfer to a canonical url rather than a redirect as we do in index.php.
3. Reducing number of if statements while accomplishing the same.
4. Integrate Strong Customer Authentication so as to comply with European laws.
5. Right now, the token only includes postal code, expiry date, cvc number, and card number. I would like to integrate address and other info into the token too, (I'm not sure that's even possible).

Any assistance you can offer to assist with anything above or something else we have not thought of is greatly appreciated. thank you.
